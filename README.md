<h1>Flight Delay Prediction Analysis</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Flight delays create problems in scheduling for airlines and airports, leading to passenger inconvenience and huge economic losses. As a result, there is growing interest in predicting flight delays to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction. In this project, a machine learning problem is framed by predicting departure delays (no delay), where a delay is defined as a 15-minute delay (or greater) concerning the planned departure time. This prediction is made two hours before departure (thereby giving airlines and airports time to regroup and give passengers a heads-up on a delay).</p>
